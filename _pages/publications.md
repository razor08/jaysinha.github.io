[Efficient Deep CNN-BiLSTM Model for Network Intrusion Detection](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3430199.3430224) | 3rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Pattern Recognition @ Huaqiao University, Xiamen, China (25th - 27th Sept 2020)
The model proposes an effective approach towards Network Intrusion Detection in cloud systems with active monitoring using Neural Networks. The proposed model combines spatial and temporal feature sets from CNN and BiLSTM on time range datasets to accurately predict network attacks and the category of attack to which they belong to. - [Preprint](https://jaysinha.me/files/aipr_20_ids_paper_pre_print.pdf) | [Code](https://lab.jaysinha.me/jay/Network-IDS-CNN-BiLSTM)

PhishX: An Empirical Approach to Phishing Detection | Preprint available
Phishing techniques and attacks have been prevalent recently after they were first proposed in the 1980s. Yearly unique phishing
attacks exceeded 1 million in 2015 and have been on the rise ever
since. With the introduction of money-spinning ransomware attacks, phishing has become much more lucrative in order to make
the first breach. Technology companies offer products ranging from
blacklists to heuristics which can often prove ineffective when
pinned against semantics-based attack structures. In this paper, we
take an empirical approach towards phishing detection by proposing a data set taking into account 198 features extracted from more
than 73,000 phishing websites. All the features taken into account
don’t require human intervention and are fully automated to help
capture vast distribution among phishing URLs and their distinct
combination of features. We also provide detailed analysis using
Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, out of which Random Forest makes 93.09% accurate detection of phishing pages with
an FPR of 0.122 when paired with the same features extracted from
random 52,000 websites from the top Alexa list. - [Preprint](https://jaysinha.me/files/phishx_preprint.pdf) | [Code](https://github.com/phishx-org/PhishX-Research)
