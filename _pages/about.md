About Me
========
Hi, I am Jay. 

Research Interests
=========
I am interested in working on core deep learning methodologies to enhance the traditional methods of model training and usage in real-world applications in cybersecurity. There is already a significant body of work in this domain, but I hope to expand on it by researching possible optimizations and exploring more effective approaches that will enable the same results with reduced training times and/or from a smaller representative dataset than a usual massive dataset. 

I am broadly interested in Security, Intelligent Systems, and Machine Learning. I am currently deeply excited (& working) towards developing neural frameworks and architectures to understand program semantics and using them for cybersecurity.

Interested in Collaboration?
===========
If you are interested in collaborating with me, please feel free to drop me an email.
